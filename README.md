**Plant-Disease-Prediction-with-CNN**

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based application for predicting plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained using the PlantVillage dataset and can classify images into healthy or diseased categories.

Requirements

Python 3

TensorFlow

NumPy
